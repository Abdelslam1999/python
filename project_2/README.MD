# Project 2

## Introduction

This Python script is a simple number guessing game. The program starts by asking the user to input a maximum range value. It then generates a random number between 0 and the provided range. The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly, and then it displays the total number of guesses made.
