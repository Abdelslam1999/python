# Project 3

## Introduction

This Python script is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The user plays against the computer by typing their choice of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer randomly picks its choice, and the game determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game keeps track of the number of times the user and the computer win. The game continues until the user types "Q" to quit, at which point it displays the total wins for both the user and the computer.
